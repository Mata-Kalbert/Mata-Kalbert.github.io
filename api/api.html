    <h1>Local Storage API, Storing and Retrieving Simple Data, Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects</h1>
    <p>We can data on the browser in two ways, with local storage and with sessions.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of data stored locally, which doesn't get cleaned up automatically:</p>
    <span>Stored Name:</span><span id="resultlocal"></span>
    <p>Here's an example of data stored in a session, which gets erased when the browser closes:</p>
    <span>Stored Name:</span><span id="resultsession"></span>
<script src="api.js"></script>
